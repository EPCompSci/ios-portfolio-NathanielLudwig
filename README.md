# iOS-Portfolio
2018-2019 Portfolio

Using this space as the home base for your portfolio, make a wiki or pages like this read me to highlight what you have learned / created over this semester of class. You should consider this as much for your grade as your resume. You've got incredible work to highlight and brag about - do that here. 

I'd like you to consider this assignment as a way to get a job / internship / independent contract with someone outside the school.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!

First Project - guess 100:
For my first ios project I decided to learn swift by recreating a simple game I made last year in java. I learned how to create a app layout and UI in xCode and connect the screen elements to the code. Being able to connect visual elements to code was a feature that was new to me and was not in java. 

My Second Game:
My second game I decided to focus on learning spritekit. It is not a finished project but just a test. I learned how to create sprites and add physics. I learned about all the physics settings in spritekit which helped me create future games. I also learned features specific to apple devices like 3d touch and feedback.
